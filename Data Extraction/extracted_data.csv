(several years before, i had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when i first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work and not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) my treatment consisted of: taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. although i could notice a marked difference in my mood, i still felt that i wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as i needed to be.  i would still have days when i felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  when i discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that i add luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  that helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  my doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  it may have helped a little, but i was never quite sure. one other thing i found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  it seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day i took it, i felt calm for the first time in my life. up until then i didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because i had never known what it was like to be without it. but that very first day i took it, i felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  always before, i had a feeling inside that i can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  sort of like, ""i'm late! gotta hurry! oh, no!""  that was a feeling that i had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  for the first two weeks i took the dexadrine, i didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did i even realize i wasn't pulling, as i didn't even think about it.  unfortutely, i did go back to pulling after that. the 2 side effects i experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after i took it, and 2) it made me feel like i lost my spontaneity.  i got a lot more done, and i didn't feel so panicked, but i wasn't as much fun.  for that reason, i stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  after maybe a year or two i quit taking it altogether and when i went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  it made me feel jittery as though i'd had way too much coffee.  it just made the anxiety worse.i'm not sure if i was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. however, these four meds i've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so. i have taken a myriad of other anti-depressants in my quest to find one that would work, and i would be willing to share my experiences with those other meds as well. just let me know if you want mori info."

effexor-xr,effexor xr review by  40 year old male patient,8,"anxiety, mild depression","75 mg,37 mg  taken daily for the period of 1 year",,,"venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. it works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the sypse. the neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradreline). additiolly, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that snris may also increase dopamine transmission. this is because snris work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. if the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then snris will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).",difficulty in reaching orgasm. increased amount of ejaculate. rare mild headache.,"my uptake levels were not severely out of balance. i started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes. i was told it would take a week. i reduced the dosage to 75 mg then 37.5 mg after six months because i felt those doses to be too strong. i know others that found this drug helpful. others it had no effect on at all, even at doses of 300 mg."

(the psychiatrist determined that the anxiety was due to a chemical imbalance and not situatiol.  therefore, regular visits and/or therapy were not necessary.)  after two years on the medication, treatment ended due to ibility to tolerate the side effects noted above.  during the weening process, severe dizziness occurred.  the only way to alleviate the dizziness was to take a lexapro pill.  as the weening continued, dizziness occurred less often and longer periods of time elapsed before it was necessary to take another pill.  eventually, the dizziness ceased completely."

lexapro,lexapro review by  32 year old female patient,7,depression,15 or 20 mg / day  taken daily for the period of going on 5 years,acne,sulfacet-r topical for acne,"taking lexapro has become a staple in my life.  i come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  without some kind of anti-depressant i literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  therefore i take 15 mg prophylactically of lexapro long-term.  i would rather not be on anything at all but unfortutely have tried that in the past without success.  i do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means.","the side effects for me included slightly lowered sex drive but not completely gone and climax is still possible.  i am drowsier on this drug than i was before and have lost some of my motivation regarding goals and dreams.  however, it is worth it to also lose the insomnia and crying spells.","i have tried 20 mg per day in divided doses (10 mg a.m. and 10 mg before bed at night) as well as 15 mg per day administered once in the morning.  i prefer the 15 mg although the 20 does work a little better as long as i divide the doses.  i am staying at 15 because i would like to take as small a dose as possible while still maging my depression symptoms.  i was happier overall on 20 mg however.  oddly enough, taking 20 mg once in the morning rather than divided into a.m. and p.m. seemed to make my depression worse and i found myself crying more.  all in all the best for me is 20 mg with half in the morning and half at night.  however, for long term use i prefer to take 15 mg just once per day at night."

nolvadex,nolvadex review by  46 year old female patient,7,breast cancer,20 mg   taken daily for the period of currently 2 years,anxiety,effexor,"the benefits of tamoxifen have been to be cancer free 2 years after my diagnosis. hopefully this ""clean bill of health"" will continue as i begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. the benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. my cancer was highly estrogen-positive. lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits.","side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. i had hot flashes that were quite severe. they often came without warning especially at mealtime. i also had some body aches and pains. vagil dryness was also severe. my period became erratic. after 2 years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. my period has been non-existant for 4 months. however, i feel irritable and edgy about the regularly scheduled time for a few days. the effexor helps. dryness is still a problem but not as severe. vagil odor continues to be a concern.","i was put on tamoxifen for 5 years following my 9/05 breast cancer diagnosis. i started tamoxifen 12/05. i started zoloft 2 months later when i began having mood swings. zoloft helped for a year then i felt my symptoms returning. i began effexor at 75 mg and have been fine. my oncologist felt i am young and strong (age 46, exercise 4 times weekly, runner, martial artist) and that i should try to lower or end my effexor. however, i didn't agree. i needed help with the mood swings and irritability. i can't lose my temper at work. i work with developmentally disabled adults. losing my temper could be my job. i did try a tural regime of vitamins (b-12 and e) for several months but i felt no relief. friends even told me about my mood. i went from depressed to angry in a flash. the 75 mg of effexor is wonderful. my estrogen is blocked by the tamoxifen and the effexor helps keep me at an even keel."

propecia,propecia review by  38 year old male patient,8,male pattern baldness,1 mg  taken once a day for the period of 4 weeks,asthma.,.,"ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. so far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. i expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as i had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. in other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. so far, this has not occurred. the product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so i really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. in terms of halting the process, however, i must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. i will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, i suppose.","i was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull. this pressure would subside and i would go about my day. i'm told headaches are not one of the usual side-effects, so it may be an unrelated fluke. however, i've never had such an experience before, and it only manifested within about forty-eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy-two hours thereafter. the sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided, however, but i would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout, especially if driving or in a public place with bright lights and a lot of noise around.","overall, whether i am having some sort of placebo-effect reaction or not, my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller. i presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day, which i filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately. the formulation i was prescribed was 1 milligram, although i believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams. my case was mild to begin with, so it may be difficult to judge results. however, other than the mild side-effects i described above, which subsided within three days, i must say overall that my experience has been a positive one."

provigil,provigil review by  55 year old male patient,1,daytime sleepiness,100mg   taken 3 per day for the period of 7 weeks,depression,cymbalta,virtually . please< please read on....,"if you take a look at the side effects the fda requires provigil manufacturer cephalon to list, you will find the usual stomach aches, headaches etc.. such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don't bother reading the side effect profile for meds. however, failing to look at the side effects for provigil could end up costing you your life. provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of provigil's side you are not likely to know what it means. the side effect is called ""vasodilatation"", and the manufacturer reported to the fda that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. what is ""vasodilatation""?  vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable ""vasodilation"", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  and, if you'll read on, you'll see why for me, and potentially for 1 out of every 50 users of provigil, it very nearly killed me.  after 7 weeks on provigil, with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day, i awoke one morning in a highly delusiol state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and i were seated. after apparently collapsing in my bedroom, i was taken to er, which quickly determined that i was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). i quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an er,  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. those who survive likely do so, as i did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy cpr session.","my er doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. arriving quickly, he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regiol heart center 35 miles away. as he awaited the ambulance, he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab, not to put a stent in, but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destition next to my aorta, after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. the balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart, then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additiol falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. arriving at the heart center i was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for 9 days, kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs (""i'm in"", the tv doctors always say when the get the insertion right)."

retin-a-micro,retin-a micro review by  60 year old female patient,10,sun damage to face,0.1%  (dosage frequency: every other night)  for the period of 1 year +,rosacea in nose area,stri-vectin,"the prescription recommended that i use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  i alterte one night of retin-a, 1 night of stri-vectin.  the retin-a causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that i don't look as if my face has dandruff.  i use a clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  i have also used benefit's ""bluff dust"" to cover the redness that the retin-a gel causes, and continue to use noritate for my rosacea.  the retin-a is very effective, but also quite expensive.  i have found a pharmacy in cada where i can order it online for less than 50% the us price.  i hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  i have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because i am a committed scowler.  i do not believe that retin-a would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my persol opinion and is based only on my own experience.","some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when i started writing a response to the first question, i didn't see what was to follow.  the retin-a gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  for this reason, i used it every other day instead of every day. i alterte with stri-vectin.  i also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!when exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  i have used benefit cosmetics' ""bluff puff"" to tone down the redness; i have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  however, my complexion looks great without makeup.  i still use mascara and liner and shadow.","before going to bed, i wash my face with the clarisonic brush.  i love it!when my face is clean and dry, i apply a pea-sized amount of retin-a gel all over my face and neck.  i do not avoid the eye area, but i do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  i also put talika lipocils on my eyelashes.  in the morning i wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  then i moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  this does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  the following night i wash my face and when it is clean and dry, i apply stri-vectin.  i alterte so that one night i use retin-a and the next night i use stri-vectin or another moisturizer.  i don't think i will be buying any more stri-vectin because i am doubtful of its effectiveness and because i would prefer to make my own product.  i know that i will be uble to make retin-a gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me."

seasonique,seasonique review by  21 year old female patient,5,birth control,1 pill  taken 1 pill every day for the period of 3 months,,,"i thought the benefits would be one period every 3 months, pregncy prevention, regulated periods. i also read that they would be lighter and shorter and help with acne. wrong!","well i was quite leary about starting seasonique, i was already taking yaz and i loved it, but 4 periods a year why pass that up. from the moment i started taking it, it wasn't a decreased sex drive, i had  at all, which made the birth control completely useless to me. in addition to that, the acne just kept getting worse, i didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasiol blemish here and there. it started getting worse on my face, then my chest, then my back, (it's not just one here or one there, my back, chest, and chin are seriously covered) i've even had one on my ribs! crazy! my boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. it was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explation). i went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. lastly, i've been fretting the last 2 weeks because i still haven't gotten my period! i never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. the dr. said i would bleed between... still not bleeding! i've taken 3 pregncy tests, wasted 10 bucks on each! oh yeah, i've been crying for no reason at all the last month. i started crying over some lady i didn't even know at work. i do not recommend taking seasonique. i know it must be expensive although i don't know how much because my dr. gave me sample packs and i'm not going to bother refilling it. also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. it wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and i still have no clue as to why i haven't gotten a period yet). i've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. this is the first time i tried one where i only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. if you are looking for a good pill, yaz worked great for me and i never had any breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, loss of sex drive, acne or anything. hope this helps.","1 pill every day for 12 weeks, then 1 week of period pills"

xax,xax review by  38 year old male patient,8,anxiety/depression,.5mg bid  taken twice daily for the period of 2 months,dependence,suboxone,"i took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. it did work considerably in the beginning, however i would occasiolly sleep the day away if taken in the morning. i would wake up from ps with a terrible disposition. it did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. in retrospect, i shouldn't have taken the medication because i was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because i have an addictive persolity. i discussed this with my dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. i later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. also, i've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. i think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. i don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. if you have an addictive persolity like myself, i think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. but exhaust other altertives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, i think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. i suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. i only say this because i know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are very unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. it is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. i will also say gladly, that i have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and  of them have developed a dependency on them. the bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","i was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. i became afraid of it because i was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, i was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression."

(down to 168 lbs.) and my cholesterol went from 265 to 199. i was told at that time i was taking orlistat. the participants who took orlistat lost more weight than the ones who took placebo and did the low-fat diet. i can only remember once having what may have been an oily stool. i never had cramps, diarrhea or any type of bowel accidents. it is now 2010, and i have put on 20 lbs. since. i am considering trying to get my family doctor to prescribe orlistat. i have not heard anything negative about the medication, except for the side effects of oily stools, etc. i believe the people who have experienced the bad side effects are people who are continuing to eat fatty foods (such as pizza, cheeseburgers, etc.) and continue to take the orlistat. if you follow the directions, you are to eat low-fat and also take a multi-vitamin. i look forward to trying out the orlistat again. :)"

zomig,zomig review by  36 year old female patient,7,migraine,2.5 mg  taken 2-6 times per month for the period of 6 years,"celiac disease, multiple allergies",birth control pills,the benefits of taking zomig are suppression of migraine/headache pain for at least 12-24 hours.  sometimes the migraine would return after this time but usually it went away completely until the next attack.,the side effects of taking zomig for me are ibility to wake (if taken before sleeping) and extreme drowsiness/fogginess if taken while remaining awake.,"i can take zomig to alleviate any headache pain (including hangovers) which is odd because my doctor told me it would only work on migraines.  the sooner i  take it the faster it works.  if i take it and lie down in a dark room it works faster but i have a very difficult time waking up unless a full night has passed.  if i take it during the day and have to be at work it takes much longer to work (around three hours).  it also makes me feel very foggy and i cannot drive. sometimes i have to take a second dose, but it has always worked after that.  sometimes if i catch the headache early enough and go to bed i can cut the dose in half and it still works.  it's success seems to be closely tied to the ability to get away from light, sounds and smells that tend to aggrivate the migraine. if i wait too long to take it, usea sets in and i cannot keep the medication down.  then i need to take the sublingual dose, which i don't like to purchase because i can't divide the doses at all.  i am very happy to have a medicine that alleviates the extreme migraine pain but i wish it didn't make me so drowsy because that still cuts into my productivity."
