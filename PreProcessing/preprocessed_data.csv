propecia,38,male,male pattern baldness,1 mg  taken once a day for the period of 4 weeks,asthma.,.,7,positive,ostensibly this product will prevent further hair loss while the initial male pattern baldness is mild i fear worsening of the condition and am taking this a a preventive measure,i experienced sharp burst of pain in the top rear left quadrant of my head intermittently for about seventy two hour of commencing treatment these subsided and may or may not be related to the medication,i began taking the product to stave off the onset of male pattern baldness a the treatment is said to show full effect in two year my four week course is probably not enough to show result i will report again in due time
propecia,38,male,male pattern baldness,1 mg  taken once a day for the period of 4 weeks,asthma.,.,8,positive,ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effect of male pattern baldness so far one month in there is not a great deal to report i expected my hair loss to temporarily increase a i had read in the literature that a dormant hair follicle reactivate they push dead hair out in order to form new one in other word hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few month and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new so far this ha not occurred the product must be taken for up to two year for any noticeable hair growth to take place so i really have not been on it long enough to judge it re growth potential in term of halting the process however i must say there are fewer hair in my brush each morning so it is possible the drug is having an effect already i will post a fuller report in another forty seven month i suppose,i wa surprised to experience brief blinding headache in the upper left rear quadrant of my head like a mini second long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull this pressure would subside and i would go about my day i am told headache are not one of the usual side effect so it may be an unrelated fluke however i have never had such an experience before and it only manifested within about forty eight hour of my first taking the drug and for seventy two hour thereafter the sudden and sporadic burst of acute pain subsided however but i would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout especially if driving or in a public place with bright light and a lot of noise around,overall whether i am having some sort of placebo effect reaction or not my subjective impression is that hair loss ha slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller i presented my symptom to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day which i filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately the formulation i wa prescribed wa 1 milligram although i believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligram and can go a high a 5 milligram my case wa mild to begin with so it may be difficult to judge result however other than the mild side effect i described above which subsided within three day i must say overall that my experience ha been a positive one
propecia,55,male,thinning hair and balding,1 mg per day  taken daily for the period of 6 months,,,9,positive,the crown of my head wa almost totally bald at age 54 and the remaining hair very thin the front of my head wa transplanted if you looked at me in the daylight you would say that i had a balding problem and of course with the transplant i looked strange after 6 month it totally covered my crown and increased the texture of the remaining hair to a coarser density all of the fine hair which were dormant came back with stronger and previous strength follicle the transplanted hair on the top also became coarser except in a very strong light looking directly down on the top of my head now no one would say i wa bald or even thinning i am totally amazed with this product at age 55 and should have started taking it at 25,no change in sex drive far le ejaculate than before however age 55 might have something to do with that,1 mg per day and that wa it
